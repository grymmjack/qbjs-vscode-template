# About QBJS

QBJS is an implementation of the Basic programming language for the web, with multimedia support and easy sharing of programs. It aims to be compatible with QB64, which in turn implements the same dialect as the classic QBasic.

The project is in active development as of 30 March 2022. It can be tried online on itch.io; documentation and releases are hosted on GitHub.

Support for browser APIs is built-in as of version 0.3.0-beta; a game engine is included separately.
